# 1 Introduction

Singapore is one of the global city that has yet to legalise short-term rentals offered by platforms such as Airbnb. However, there are data sets of Airbnb in Singapore, and they can be found from the Inside Airbnb website (http://insideairbnb.com/about.html). Hence, we are interested to analyse Airbnb in Singapore.

This analysis consist of two sections:

1) Section A: Airbnb Distribution in 2019

2) Section B: Impact of COVID-19

# 2 Data

- Airbnb Listings (June 2019 & July 2021) is the Airbnb Listing in Singapore for the year 2019 and 2021. It is in csv format, and can be taken from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
- Hotels data  is the list of hotels in Singapore. It is in csv format, and can be extracted from SLA OneMap Service using onemapsapi.
- Tourist Attractions data is the list of tourist attractions in Singapore. It is in csv format, and can be extracted from SLA OneMap Service using onemapsapi.
- MrtLrtStnPtt contains all the Mrt and Lrt stations in Singapore. It is in ESRI shapefile format, and can be taken from https://datamall.lta.gov.sg/
- MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL is URA 2014 Master Plan Planning Subzone boundary data. It is in ESRI shapefile format, and can be taken from https://www.data.gov.sg/.
- CostalOutline is the national boundary of Singapore. It is in ESRI shapefile format, and can taken from SLA website.

# 3 Setting Up the Environment

The following code chunk install the following packages:

- maptools to convert Spatial objects into ppp format
- sf to handle geospatial data
- raster to convert image output generate by spatstat into raster format.
- spatstat to perform 1st and 2nd-order spatial point patterns analysis and derive kernel density estimation (KDE) layer
- tmap to create choropleth maps
- tidyr to tidy messy data
- readr to import csv
- osmdata to get bounding box of a given location name
- tmaptools to read open street map data

```{r}
packages = c('maptools', 'sf', 'raster','spatstat', 'tmap', 'tidyr', 'readr', 'osmdata', 'tmaptools')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```


# 4 Spatial Data Wrangling

## 4.1 Importing Geospatial Data 

### 4.1.1 MrtLrt

#### 4.1.1.1 Importing

The following code uses st_read function of sf package to import MrtLrt geospatial data sets.

```{r}
mrtlrt_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer="MRTLRTStnPtt")
```

The MrtLrt data have 185 features with 3 fields. The projected CRS is SVY21. The geometry type is point. 

#### 4.1.1.2 Check CRS

Next, we use st_crs function of sf package to check the CRS.

```{r}
st_crs(mrtlrt_sf)
```

From the result above, even though the mrtlrt_sf is projected in svy21, the last line indicates that the EPSG is 9001. It is wrong because the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.

#### 4.1.1.3 Assign EPSG code to a simple feature data frame

The following code chunk will assign the correct EPSG code to mrtlrt_sf using st_set_crs function of sf package

```{r}
mrtlrt_sf <- st_set_crs(mrtlrt_sf, 3414)
```

Now that we have assign the correct EPSG code to mrtlrt_sf, we will check the CRS again using st_crs function of sf

#### 4.1.1.4 Check CRS again

```{r}
st_crs(mrtlrt_sf)
```

From the result above, we have successfully assign EPSG 3414 to mrtlrt_sf.

### 4.1.2 CostalOutline

#### 4.1.2.1 Importing

The following code uses st_read function of sf package to import CostalOutline geospatial data sets.

```{r}
sg_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer="CostalOutline")
```

The CostalOutline data have 60 features with 4 fields. The projected CRS is SVY21. The geometry type is polygon.

#### 4.1.2.2 Check CRS

Next, we use st_crs function of sf package to check the CRS.

```{r}
st_crs(sg_sf)
```

Similarly, even though the sg_sf is projected in svy21, the last line indicates that the EPSG is 9001. It is wrong because the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.

#### 4.1.2.3 Assign EPSG code to a simple feature data frame

The following code chunk will assign the correct EPSG code to sg_sf using st_set_crs function of sf package

```{r}
sg_sf <- st_set_crs(sg_sf, 3414)
```

Now that we have assign the correct EPSG code to sg_sf, we will check the CRS again using st_crs function of sf

#### 4.1.2.4 Check CRS again

```{r}
st_crs(sg_sf)
```
We have successfully set the EPSG to 3414 for sg_sf.

### 4.1.3 MPSZ

#### 4.1.3.1 Importing

The following code uses st_read function of sf package to import MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL geospatial data sets.

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

The mpsz data have 323 features with 15 fields. The projected CRS is SVY21. The geometry type is multipolygon.

#### 4.1.3.2 Check CRS

Next, we use st_crs function of sf package to check the CRS.

```{r}
st_crs(mpsz_sf)
```

Similarly, even though the mpsz_sf is projected in svy21, the last line indicates that the EPSG is 9001. It is wrong because the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.

#### 4.1.3.3 Assign EPSG code to a simple feature data frame

The following code chunk will assign the correct EPSG code to mpsz_sf using st_set_crs function of sf package

```{r}
mpsz_sf <- st_set_crs(mpsz_sf, 3414)
```

Now that we have assign the correct EPSG code to mpsz_sf, we will check the CRS again using st_crs function of sf

#### 4.1.3.4 Check CRS again

```{r}
st_crs(mpsz_sf)
```

We have successfully assign ESPG 3414 to mpsz_sf.

## 4.2 Importing Aspatial Data 

### 4.2.1 Hotel

#### 4.2.1.1 Importing

The following code uses read_csv function of readr package to import Hotel aspatial data sets.

```{r}
hotels <- read_csv("data/aspatial/hotels.csv")
```

#### 4.2.1.2 Examine the file

The following code uses list function of base R to examine the imported file

```{r}
list(hotels)
```

The data contains 422 rows and 9 columns. There are 'Lat' and 'Lng' column for coordinates. They are in decimal degree format, hence we will assume the data is wgs84.

We will next check if there are any NA value in 'Lat' and 'Lng' using is.na function of base R package.

```{r}
any(is.na(hotels$Lat))
```

```{r}
any(is.na(hotels$Lng))
```

We can confirmed that there are no NA values and we can proceed to create a simple feature data frame.

#### 4.2.1.3 Create simple feature data frame from aspatial data

The following code chunk

1. convert hotels data  into simple feature data frame using st_as_sf feature of sf package.

2. 'Lng' and 'Lat' column are set as the coords arguments.

3. CRS were set as 4326 since we assumed that the data is wgs84

4. st_transform function of sf package then helps to transform the newly created simple feature data frame into svy21

5. tm_shape and tm_dots function of tmap plots the transformed hotels_sf

```{r}
hotels_sf <- st_as_sf(hotels,
                    coords = c("Lng", 
                               "Lat"),
                    crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)

tm_shape(hotels_sf)+
  tm_dots()
```

### 4.2.2 Tourism

#### 4.2.2.1 Importing

The following code uses read_csv function of readr package to import Tourism aspatial data sets.

```{r}
tourism <- read_csv("data/aspatial/tourism.csv")
```

#### 4.2.2.2 Examine the file

The following code uses list function of base R to examine the imported file

```{r}
list(tourism)
```

The tourism data contains 107 rows and 17 columns. There are 'LATITUDE' and 'LONGTITUDE' column, as well as 'Lat' and 'Lng' coluumn for coordinates. We will be using 'LATITUDE' and 'LONGTITUDE' column since they are the same. They are in decimal degree format, hence we will assume the data is wgs84.

We will next check if there are any NA value in 'LATITUDE' and 'LONGTITUDE' using is.na function of base R package.

```{r}
any(is.na(tourism$LATITUDE))
```

```{r}
any(is.na(tourism$LATITUDE))
```

There are NA values and we will need to drop them before creating a simple feature data frame.

The following code chunk drop rows of data as long as the LATITUDE is NA.

```{r}
tourism <- tourism %>%
            drop_na("LATITUDE")
```


#### 4.2.2.3 Create simple feature data frame from aspatial data

The following code chunk is similar to the previous when we convert hotels aspatial data to sf. The 'LONGTITUDE' and 'LATITUDE' column are set as the coords arguments.

```{r}

tourism_sf <- st_as_sf(tourism,
                    coords = c("LONGTITUDE", 
                               "LATITUDE"),
                    crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)

tm_shape(tourism_sf)+
  tm_dots()
```

### 4.2.3 Airbnb0619

#### 4.2.3.1 Importing

The following code uses read_csv function of readr package to import Airbnb listings30062019.csv aspatial data sets.

```{r}
airbnb0619 <- read_csv("data/aspatial/listings30062019.csv")
```

#### 4.2.3.2 Examine the file

The following code uses list function of base R to examine the imported file

```{r}
list(airbnb0619)
```

The airbnb0619 data contains 8293 rows and 16 columns. There are 'latitude' and 'longitude' column for coordinates. They are in decimal degree format, hence we will assume the data is wgs84.

We will next check if there are any NA value in 'latitude' and 'longitude' using is.na function of base R package.

```{r}
any(is.na(airbnb0619$latitude))
```

```{r}
any(is.na(airbnb0619$longitude))
```

Since there are no NA values, we can proceed to create simple features data frame for airbnb0619

#### 4.2.3.3 Create simple feature data frame from aspatial data

The following code chunk is similar to the previous when we convert hotels aspatial data to sf. The 'longitude' and 'latitude' column are set as the coords arguments.

```{r}
airbnb0619_sf <- st_as_sf(airbnb0619,
                    coords = c("longitude", 
                               "latitude"),
                    crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)

tm_shape(airbnb0619_sf)+
  tm_dots()
```

### 4.2.4 Airbnb0721

#### 4.2.4.1 Importing

The following code uses read_csv function of readr package to import Airbnb listings19072021.csv aspatial data sets.

```{r}
airbnb0721 <- read_csv("data/aspatial/listings19072021.csv")
```

#### 4.2.4.2 Examine the file

The following code uses list function of base R to examine the imported file

```{r}
list(airbnb0721)
```

The airbnb0721 data contains 4252 rows and 16 columns, lesser than airbnb0619. There are 'latitude' and 'longitude' column for coordinates. They are in decimal degree format, hence we will assume the data is wgs84.

We will next check if there are any NA value in 'latitude' and 'longitude' using is.na function of base R package.

```{r}
any(is.na(airbnb0721$latitude))
```

```{r}
any(is.na(airbnb0721$longitude))
```

We can confirm that there are no latitude and longitude with NA value.

#### 4.2.4.3 Create simple feature data frame from aspatial data

The following code chunk is similar to the previous when we convert hotels aspatial data to sf. The 'longitude' and 'latitude' column are set as the coords arguments.

```{r}
airbnb0721_sf <- st_as_sf(airbnb0721,
                    coords = c("longitude", 
                               "latitude"),
                    crs=4326) %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)

tm_shape(airbnb0721_sf)+
  tm_dots()
```

## 4.3 Geospatial Data wrangling

After importing geospatial and aspatial data, we will convert the simple feature data frame to sp’s Spatial* class.

### 4.3.1 Converting sf data frames to sp’s Spatial* class

The following code chunk converts all the geospatial data from simple feature data frame to sp’s Spatial* class using as_Spatial functions of sf package.

```{r}
airbnb0619 <- as_Spatial(airbnb0619_sf)
airbnb0721 <- as_Spatial(airbnb0721_sf)
hotels <- as_Spatial(hotels_sf)
tourism <- as_Spatial(tourism_sf)
mrtlrt <- as_Spatial(mrtlrt_sf)
sg <- as_Spatial(sg_sf)
mpsz <- as_Spatial(mpsz_sf)
```

Check each Spatial* class

```{r}
airbnb0619
```

```{r}
airbnb0721
```

```{r}
hotels
```

```{r}
tourism
```

```{r}
mrtlrt
```

```{r}
sg
```

```{r}
mpsz
```

We can see that all the geospatial data are converted to their respective Spatial* Classes.

### 4.3.2 Converting the Spatial* class into generic sp format

Next, we will convert Spatial* classes into Spatial object so that we can convert it into ppp object.

The following code chunk converts Spatial* classes into generic sp format using as function which sets the classes to their respective sp format. 

```{r}
airbnb0619_sp <- as(airbnb0619, "SpatialPoints")
airbnb0721_sp <- as(airbnb0721, "SpatialPoints")
hotels_sp <- as(hotels, "SpatialPoints")
tourism_sp <- as(tourism, "SpatialPoints")
mrtlrt_sp <- as(mrtlrt, "SpatialPoints")
sg_sp <- as(sg, "SpatialPolygons")
mpsz_sp <- as(mpsz, "SpatialPolygons")
```

### 4.3.3 Converting the generic sp format into spatstat’s ppp format

We will next convert the spatial data into spatstat's ppp format.

The following code chunk converts spatial data into spatstat's ppp format using as function. 

```{r}
airbnb0619_ppp <- as(airbnb0619_sp, "ppp")
airbnb0721_ppp <- as(airbnb0721_sp, "ppp")
hotels_ppp <- as(hotels_sp, "ppp")
tourism_ppp <- as(tourism_sp, "ppp")
mrtlrt_ppp <- as(mrtlrt_sp, "ppp")
```

### 4.3.4 Handling duplicates in ppp object

#### 4.3.4.1 Check for dupliciates duplicates in each ppp object

The following code chunk use any and duplicated function of base R package to check for duplicates, and sum up the count of duplicated points using sum function of base R package and multiplicity function of spatstat package.

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0619_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0619_ppp) > 1)
```

From the result above, there are 6 duplicates in airbnb0619_ppp object. 

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0721_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0721_ppp) > 1)
```

From the result above, there are 224 duplicates in airbnb0721_ppp object. 

```{r}
any(duplicated(hotels_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(hotels_ppp) > 1)
```

From the result above, there are 10 duplicates in hotels_ppp object.

```{r}
any(duplicated(tourism_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(tourism_ppp) > 1)
```

From the result above, there are 7 duplicates in tourism_ppp object.

```{r}
any(duplicated(mrtlrt_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(mrtlrt_ppp) > 1)
```

From the result above, there are no duplicate in mrtlrt_ppp object.

#### 4.3.4.2 Handling duplicates

We will use jittering to handle duplicates so that we will not lose useful points. Jittering adds a small perturbation to the duplicated points so that they do not occupy the exact same space.

The following code chunk uses rjitter function of spatstat to jitter the ppp object with duplicates.

```{r}
airbnb0619_ppp_jit <- rjitter(airbnb0619_ppp, 
                             retry=TRUE, 
                             nsim=1, 
                             drop=TRUE)

airbnb0721_ppp_jit <- rjitter(airbnb0721_ppp, 
                             retry=TRUE, 
                             nsim=1, 
                             drop=TRUE)

hotels_ppp_jit <- rjitter(hotels_ppp, 
                             retry=TRUE, 
                             nsim=1, 
                             drop=TRUE)

tourism_ppp_jit <- rjitter(tourism_ppp, 
                             retry=TRUE, 
                             nsim=1, 
                             drop=TRUE)
```

#### 4.3.4.3 Check if duplicates still exist

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0619_ppp_jit))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0619_ppp_jit) > 1)
```

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0721_ppp_jit))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0721_ppp_jit) > 1)
```

```{r}
any(duplicated(hotels_ppp_jit))
sum(multiplicity(hotels_ppp_jit) > 1)
```

```{r}
any(duplicated(tourism_ppp_jit))
sum(multiplicity(tourism_ppp_jit) > 1)
```

We can confirm that there are no duplicated points after jittering.

### 4.3.5 Create owin objects

We will next create owin object to represent the Singapore boundary.

The following code chunk converts sg SpatialPolygon objects into owin object of spatstat using as function. 

```{r}
sg_owin <- as(sg_sp, "owin")
```

The following code chunk plots sg_owin using plot function of base R package.

```{r}
plot(sg_owin)
```

### 4.3.6 Combining point events object and owin object

The following code chunk combines the point objects of airbnb0619, airbnb0721, hotels, tourism and mrtlrt with the owin object into one ppp object class.

```{r}
airbnb0619SG_ppp = airbnb0619_ppp_jit[sg_owin]
airbnb0721SG_ppp = airbnb0721_ppp_jit[sg_owin]
hotelsSG_ppp = hotels_ppp_jit[sg_owin]
tourismSG_ppp = tourism_ppp_jit[sg_owin]
mrtlrtSG_ppp = mrtlrt_ppp[sg_owin]
```

The following code chunk plots the ppp object class using plot function of base R package.

```{r}
plot(airbnb0619SG_ppp)
```

```{r}
plot(airbnb0721SG_ppp)
```

```{r}
plot(hotelsSG_ppp)
```

```{r}
plot(tourismSG_ppp)
```

```{r}
plot(mrtlrtSG_ppp)
```

# 5 Section A: Airbnb Distribution in 2019

## 5.1 Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis

### 5.1.1 Kernel density maps

#### 5.1.1.1 Airbnb0619 listings

##### 5.1.1.1.1 Compute kernel density estimation with automatic bandwidth selection method

1. The following code chunk computes kernel density using density function of spatstat package.

2. The code first takes in the ppp object variable.

3. bw.diggle automatic bandwidth method to detect a tight cluster

4. smoothing kernel is set to default gaussian method 

```{r}
kde_airbnb0619SG_bw <- density(airbnb0619SG_ppp,
                              sigma=bw.diggle,
                              edge=TRUE,
                            kernel="gaussian")
```

The following code chunk plots the kde_airbnb0619SG_bw using plot function of base R

```{r}
plot(kde_airbnb0619SG_bw)
```

The density values of the output range is too small because the default unit of measurement of svy21 is in meter. As a result, the density values computed is in “number of units per square meter”.

##### 5.1.1.1.2 Rescalling KDE values

The following code chunk rescale the KDE value of airbnb0619SG_ppp using rescale function of spatstat from meter to kilometer.

```{r}
airbnb0619SG_ppp.km <- rescale(airbnb0619SG_ppp, 1000, "km")
```

##### 5.1.1.1.3 Different automatic bandwidth methods

The following code chunk calculate the bandwidth using different methods

```{r}
bw.CvL(airbnb0619SG_ppp.km)
```

```{r}
bw.scott(airbnb0619SG_ppp.km)
```

```{r}
bw.ppl(airbnb0619SG_ppp.km)
```

```{r}
bw.diggle(airbnb0619SG_ppp.km)
```

From the result above, bw.diggle has the lowest sigma compared to other methods. We will be using bw.diggle in this analysis in order to detect close cluster.

##### 5.1.1.1.4 KDE Map and Point Map in km

1. The following code chunk computes kernel density using density function of spatstat package.

2. The code first takes in the ppp object variable in km.

3. bw.diggle automatic bandwidth method to detect a tight cluster

4. smoothing kernel is set to default gaussian method

5. plot function of base R package and par function of graphics package is used to plot kde map and ppp point map side by side

```{r}
kde_airbnb0619SG_bw.km <- density(airbnb0619SG_ppp.km,
                              sigma=bw.diggle,
                              edge=TRUE,
                            kernel="gaussian")


par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(kde_airbnb0619SG_bw.km, main = "KDE Map")
plot(airbnb0619SG_ppp.km, main = "Point Map")
```

Analysis: From the kde map above, we can see that the south-east region near the central area have higher density of Airbnb in 2019 as shown by the pink spots on kde map and the black patches on the point map. The kde map better visualised the density as compared to the point map because it uses different colour tone to represent the density. For example, purple means no/low number of units per square kilometer, pink represents medium density of about 1000 units per square kilometer, and yellow means high density of about 1500 units per square kilometer. The point map on the other hand cannot determine if an area is denser than the other area since it is only represented in one colour tone, black, and black patches can be seen almost every where in the point map.

##### 5.1.1.1.5 Convert KDE output into grid object in km

The following code chunk converts KDE output into grid object using as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im function of maptools, and plot the grid object using spplot function of raster package.


```{r}
gridded_kde_airbnb0619SG_bw.km <- as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im(kde_airbnb0619SG_bw.km)
spplot(gridded_kde_airbnb0619SG_bw.km)
```

Analysis: The above density map shows a clearer visualization of the density of Airbnb in 2019 using grid. We can see that the Airbnb are scattered all around as seen by the lighter blue grid on the map. The south-east area near the central have higher density with around 500 - 1500 units per square kilometer, represented by the brighter blue, pink-orange grid on the map.

##### 5.1.1.1.6 Convert grid object into raster

The following code chunk converts grid object into raster using raster function of raster package. Note that we will be using kde_airbnb0619SG_bw in m.

```{r}
gridded_kde_airbnb0619SG_bw <- as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im(kde_airbnb0619SG_bw)
kde_airbnb0619SG_bw_raster <- raster(gridded_kde_airbnb0619SG_bw)
kde_airbnb0619SG_bw_raster
```

From the result above, the crs is NA.

##### 5.1.1.1.7 Assign project system and plot raster on osm

1. The following code chunk first assign CRS to kde_airbnb0619SG_bw_raster 

2. Plot the raster on OpenstreetMap basemap in interactive mode

3. tmap_mode is set to view to plot interative map

4. tm_shape is the raster layer

5. tm_raster with setting of alpha = 0.7 makes the raster layer slightly transparent so that the basemap can be seen, palette set to Purples

6. tm_basemap is set to OpenStreetMap

Analysis: Even though there are already some hotels available and only one tourist attraction, there are still many Airbnb in Kallang. There are eight MRT stations, which may be the reason why there are many Airbnb located in this area.

###### 5.1.1.6.9.2 Geylang

The following code chunk plots airbnb, hotel, mrt and tourist attraction in Geylang.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(airbnb0619_gl_ppp.km, main = "Airbnb")
plot(hotels_gl_ppp.km, main = "Hotel")
plot(mrtlrt_gl_ppp.km, main = "Mrt")
plot(tourism_gl_ppp.km, main = "Tourist Attraction")
```

Analysis: Similar to Kallang, even though there are already quite a number of hotels in Geylang and no tourist attraction, there are still many Airbnb. There are a number of Mrt stations, which may be the reason why there are many Airbnb located in this area.

###### 5.1.1.6.9.3 Outram

The following code chunk plots airbnb, hotel, mrt and tourist attraction in Outram.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(airbnb0619_ot_ppp.km, main = "Airbnb")
plot(hotels_ot_ppp.km, main = "Hotel")
plot(mrtlrt_ot_ppp.km, main = "Mrt")
plot(tourism_ot_ppp.km, main = "Tourist Attraction")
```

Analysis: Even though there are already a few hotels in Outram, there are still many Airbnb. The accessibility to the few MRT and  tourist attractions can be the reason why Outram have many Airbnb. In addition, we can see that the area with most Airbnbs (black patch) area where the tourist attractions are located.

###### 5.1.1.6.9.4 Downtown Core

The following code chunk plots airbnb, hotel, mrt and tourist attraction in Downtown Core.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(airbnb0619_dc_ppp.km, main = "Airbnb")
plot(hotels_dc_ppp.km, main = "Hotel")
plot(mrtlrt_dc_ppp.km, main = "Mrt")
plot(tourism_dc_ppp.km, main = "Tourist Attraction")
```

Analysis: In Downtown core, there are still many airbnb despite many hotels already available. The accessibility to many MRTs and multiple tourist attractions may be the reason that many airbnb are located in this area.

Overall, we can conclude that there are no direct relationship between airbnb and hotel as we see that regardless of the number of hotel available in a region, the number of airbnb remained high. Tourist attractions also do not have direct relationship with Airbnb because areas like Kallang and Geylang still have many Airbnb even though they only have one tourist attraction in the area. The accessibility of MRT is one of the possible factor that affects the number of Airbnb in the area. 

## 5.2 Second-order Spatial Point Patterns Analysis

### 5.2.1 Nearest Neighbour Analysis

We will perform Nearest Neighbour Analysis to determine if the distributions of Airbnb in each area are random distributed or not.

#### 5.2.1.1 Hypothesis

We will perform the Clark-Evans test of aggregation for a spatial point pattern using clarkevans.test() of statspat.

Test Hypothesis:

H0 = The distribution of airbnbs are randomly distributed.

H1 = The distribution of airbnbs are not randomly distributed.

The 95% confident interval will be used.

#### 5.2.1.2 Testing and Analysis

##### 5.2.1.2.1 Testing spatial point patterns using Clark and Evans Test

1. The following code chunk performs Clark-Evans test using clarkevans.test() of statspat.
2. The spatial point pattern object is airbnb0619SG_ppp, Singapore airbnb listings in Singapore ppp object.
3. Correction is set to none
4. The clipping region is set to sg_owin
5. The type of alternative for the hypothesis is clustered.
6. The number of simulations is set to 99.

```{r}
clarkevans.test(airbnb0619SG_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion="sg_owin",
                alternative=c("clustered"),
                nsim=99)
```

Analysis: R = 0.36 is less than 1, which means the distribution of airbnb in Singapore are likely clustered. The p-value of 0.01 is smaller than 0.05. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis that the airbnb point patterns in Singapore are randomly distributed.

##### 5.2.1.2.2 Clark and Evans Test: Kallang

1. The following code chunk performs Clark-Evans test of aggregation for airbnb in Kallang using clarkevans.test() of spatstat
2. The clipping region is set to NULL
3. The type of alternative for the hypothesis is two.sided
4. The number of simulations is set to 999

```{r}
clarkevans.test(airbnb0619_kl_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion=NULL,
                alternative=c("two.sided"),
                nsim=999)
```

Analysis: The p-value of 0.002 is smaller than 0.05. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis that the airbnb point patterns in Kallang are randomly distributed.

##### 5.2.1.2.3 Clark and Evans Test: Geylang

1. The following code chunk performs Clark-Evans test of aggregation for airbnb in Geylang using clarkevans.test() of spatstat

```{r}
clarkevans.test(airbnb0619_gl_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion=NULL,
                alternative=c("two.sided"),
                nsim=999)
```

Analysis: The p-value of 0.002 is smaller than 0.05. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis that the airbnb point patterns in Geylang are randomly distributed.

##### 5.2.1.2.4 Clark and Evans Test: Outram

1. The following code chunk performs Clark-Evans test of aggregation for airbnb in Outram using clarkevans.test() of spatstat
2. The clipping region is set to NULL

4. The number of simulations is set to 999

```{r}
clarkevans.test(airbnb0619_ot_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion=NULL,
                alternative=c("two.sided"),
                nsim=999)
```

Analysis: The p-value of 0.002 is smaller than 0.05. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis that the airbnb point patterns in Outram are randomly distributed.

##### 5.2.1.2.5 Clark and Evans Test: Downtown Core

1. The following code chunk performs Clark-Evans test of aggregation for airbnb in Downtown Core using clarkevans.test() of spatstat
2. The clipping region is set to NULL
3. The type of alternative for the hypothesis is two.sided
4. The number of simulations is set to 999

```{r}
clarkevans.test(airbnb0619_dc_ppp,
                correction="none",
                clipregion=NULL,
                alternative=c("two.sided"),
                nsim=999)
```

Analysis: The p-value of 0.002 is smaller than 0.05. Hence, we reject the null hypothesis that the airbnb point patterns in Downtown Core are randomly distributed.

Overall, we can conclude that airbnb in the four areas are not randomly distributed. For further analysis, we will narrow down to two areas, Downtown Core and Outram, with R value above 0.5 and 0.7 respectively. When R is nearer to 1, the distribution are likely to be random. Hence, we are interested to further analyse the distribution of airbnb within these two region.

# 6 Section B: Impact of COVID-19

## 6.1 Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis

### 6.1.1 Kernel density maps

#### 6.1.1.1 Airbnb0721 listings

##### 6.1.1.2.1 Rescale KDE values

The following code chunk rescale the KDE value of airbnb0721SG_ppp using rescale function of spatstat from meter to kilometer.

```{r}
airbnb0721SG_ppp.km <- rescale(airbnb0721SG_ppp, 1000, "km")
```

##### 6.1.1.2.2 KDE Map in km

The following code chunk is similar to Airbnb0619's code chunk (5.1.1.1.4).

```{r}
kde_airbnb0721SG_bw.km <- density(airbnb0721SG_ppp.km,
                              sigma=bw.diggle,
                              edge=TRUE,
                            kernel="gaussian")

plot(kde_airbnb0721SG_bw.km, main = "KDE Map")
```

Analysis: From the kde map above, we can see that the south-east region near the central area have higher density of Airbnb with about 200 to 800 units per square kilometer, as shown by the purple, pink and orange spots on kde map.

##### 6.1.1.2.3 Convert KDE output into grid object in km

The following code chunk converts KDE output into grid object using as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im function of maptools, and plot the grid object using spplot function of raster package.

```{r}
gridded_kde_airbnb0721SG_bw.km <- as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im(kde_airbnb0721SG_bw.km)
spplot(gridded_kde_airbnb0721SG_bw.km)
```

Analysis: The above density map shows a clearer visualization of the density of Airbnb in 2021 using grid. We can see that the Airbnb are scattered all around as seen by the lighter blue grid on the map. The south-east area near the central have higher density with around 200 - 800 units per square kilometer, represented by the brighter blue and pink grid on the map.

##### 6.1.1.2.4 Convert into raster

1. The following code chunk first compute kernel density using density function of spatstat package with sigma set as bw.diggle and kernel set as gaussian. 

2. Note that we will be using ppp in m. 

3. Convert KDE output into grid object using as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im function of maptools

4. Convert grid object into raster using raster function of raster package

5. Assign CRS to raster layer

```{r}
kde_airbnb0721SG_bw <- density(airbnb0721SG_ppp,
                              sigma=bw.diggle,
                              edge=TRUE,
                            kernel="gaussian")

gridded_kde_airbnb0721SG_bw <- as.SpatialGridDataFrame.im(kde_airbnb0721SG_bw)

kde_airbnb0721SG_bw_raster <- raster(gridded_kde_airbnb0721SG_bw)
projection(kde_airbnb0721SG_bw_raster) <- CRS("+init=EPSG:3414")
```

#### 6.1.1.2 Comparison between Airbnb0619 and Airbnb0721

The following code chunk plots kde map of Airbnb0619 and Airbnb0721 side by side.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(kde_airbnb0619SG_bw.km, main = "Airbnb 2019")
plot(kde_airbnb0721SG_bw.km, main = "Airbnb 2021")
```

From the KDE map, the south-east region still have higher density in 2021. However, we noticed that the density of Airbnb have reduced as seen from the scale. It reduced from range 0-1500 units per square kilometer in 2019 to range 0-1000 units per square kilomete in 2021. We can conclude that Covid-19 did impact the Airbnb listing in Singapore from 2019 to 2021.

#### 6.1.1.3 Comparison between Airbnb0619 and Airbnb0721 by Room Type

##### 6.1.1.3.1 Data Wrangling

###### 6.1.1.3.1.1 Determine the unique room type

The following code checks the unique room type using unique features of base R

```{r}
unique(airbnb0619_sf$room_type)
```

We have determined that the unique room types are Private room, Entire home/apt and Shared room for Airbnb 2019.

```{r}
unique(airbnb0721_sf$room_type)
```

We have determined that the unique room types are Private room, Entire home/apt, Shared room and Hotel room for Airbnb 2021.

###### 6.1.1.3.1.2 Filter each room type from SpatialPointsDataFrame

The following code chunk filters each room type for both year.

```{r}
airbnb0619_pte = airbnb0619[airbnb0619@data$room_type == "Private room",]
airbnb0619_ent = airbnb0619[airbnb0619@data$room_type == "Entire home/apt",]
airbnb0619_sh = airbnb0619[airbnb0619@data$room_type == "Shared room",]
airbnb0721_pte = airbnb0721[airbnb0721@data$room_type == "Private room",]
airbnb0721_ent = airbnb0721[airbnb0721@data$room_type == "Entire home/apt",]
airbnb0721_sh = airbnb0721[airbnb0721@data$room_type == "Shared room",]
airbnb0721_ht = airbnb0721[airbnb0721@data$room_type == "Hotel room",]
```

```{r}
airbnb0721_sh
```

Notice that the data are in SpatialPointsDataFrame format

###### 6.1.1.3.1.3 Converting the Spatial* class into generic sp format

Next, we will convert Spatial* classes into Spatial object so that we can convert it into ppp object.

The following code chunk converts Spatial* classes into generic sp format using as function which sets the classes to their respective sp format. 

```{r}
airbnb0619_pte_sp <- as(airbnb0619_pte, "SpatialPoints")
airbnb0619_ent_sp <- as(airbnb0619_ent, "SpatialPoints")
airbnb0619_sh_sp <- as(airbnb0619_sh, "SpatialPoints")
airbnb0721_pte_sp <- as(airbnb0721_pte, "SpatialPoints")
airbnb0721_ent_sp <- as(airbnb0721_ent, "SpatialPoints")
airbnb0721_sh_sp <- as(airbnb0721_sh, "SpatialPoints")
airbnb0721_ht_sp <- as(airbnb0721_ht, "SpatialPoints")
```


###### 6.1.1.3.1.4 Converting the generic sp format into spatstat’s ppp format

We will next convert the spatial data into spatstat's ppp format.

The following code chunk converts spatial data into spatstat's ppp format using as function. 

```{r}
airbnb0619_pte_ppp <- as(airbnb0619_pte_sp, "ppp")
airbnb0619_ent_ppp <- as(airbnb0619_ent_sp, "ppp")
airbnb0619_sh_ppp <- as(airbnb0619_sh_sp, "ppp")
airbnb0721_pte_ppp <- as(airbnb0721_pte_sp, "ppp")
airbnb0721_ent_ppp <- as(airbnb0721_ent_sp, "ppp")
airbnb0721_sh_ppp <- as(airbnb0721_sh_sp, "ppp")
airbnb0721_ht_ppp <- as(airbnb0721_ht_sp, "ppp")
```

###### 6.1.1.3.1.5 Check for duplicates in each ppp's objects

The following code chunk use any and duplicated function of base R package to check for duplicates, and sum up the count of duplicated points using sum function of base R package and multiplicity function of spatstat package.

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0619_pte_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0619_pte_ppp) > 1)
```

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0619_ent_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0619_ent_ppp) > 1)
```

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0619_sh_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0619_sh_ppp) > 1)
```

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0721_pte_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0721_pte_ppp) > 1)
```

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0721_ent_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0721_ent_ppp) > 1)
```

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0721_sh_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0721_sh_ppp) > 1)
```

```{r}
any(duplicated(airbnb0721_ht_ppp))
sum(multiplicity(airbnb0721_ht_ppp) > 1)
```

###### 6.1.1.3.1.6 Handling Duplicates

We will use jittering to handle duplicates so that we will not lose useful points. Jittering adds a small perturbation to the duplicated points so that they do not occupy the exact same space.

The following code chunk uses rjitter function of spatstat to jitter the ppp object with duplicates.

```{r}
airbnb0619_ent_ppp_jit <- rjitter(airbnb0619_ent_ppp, 
                             retry=TRUE, 
                             nsim=1, 
                             drop=TRUE)

airbnb0619_sh_ppp_jit <- rjitter(airbnb0619_sh_ppp, 
                             retry=TRUE, 
                             nsim=1, 
                             drop=TRUE)

airbnb0721_pte_ppp_jit <- rjitter(airbnb0721_pte_ppp, 
                             retry=TRUE, 
                             nsim=1, 
                             drop=TRUE)

airbnb0721_ent_ppp_jit <- rjitter(airbnb0721_ent_ppp, 
                             retry=TRUE, 
                             nsim=1, 
                             drop=TRUE)

airbnb0721_sh_ppp_jit <- rjitter(airbnb0721_sh_ppp,

##### 6.1.1.3.2 KDE Map Comparison by Room type and Year

The following code chunks plot KDE map of Airbnb 2019 and 2021 by each room types side by side.

###### 6.1.1.3.2.1 Private Room

1. The following code chunk first set tmap_mode to view to plot interactive map

2. Create two maps

3. Each map is plotted with tm_shape of the raster layer, tm_raster with setting of alpha = 0.7 that makes the raster layer slightly transparent so that the basemap can be seen, palette set to Purples, tm_basemap is set to OpenStreetMap

4. tmap_arrange to arrange the plot next to each other.

5. tmap_mode change back to plot

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")

airbnb0619_pte_map <- tm_shape(kde_airbnb0619SG_pte_bw_raster) + 
                  tm_raster("v", palette = "Purples", alpha = 0.7) +
                  tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")

airbnb0721_pte_map <- tm_shape(kde_airbnb0721SG_pte_bw_raster) + 
                  tm_raster("v", palette = "Purples", alpha = 0.7) +
                  tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")

tmap_arrange(airbnb0619_pte_map, airbnb0721_pte_map)

tmap_mode("plot")
```

Analysis: In 2019, only Chinatown have high density of private as shown in dark purple. In 2021, Kallang and Jalan Besar are new areas with high density 2021. Chinatown's private room density became lower than Kallang's private room density in 2021.

###### 6.1.1.3.2.2 Entire Home/Apt

The following code chunk is similar to 6.1.1.3.2.1.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")

airbnb0619_ent_map <- tm_shape(kde_airbnb0619SG_ent_bw_raster) + 
                  tm_raster("v", palette = "Purples", alpha = 0.7) +
                  tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")

                  tm_raster("v", palette = "Purples", alpha = 0.7) +
                  tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")

tmap_arrange(airbnb0619_ent_map, airbnb0721_ent_map)

tmap_mode("plot")
```

Analysis: In 2019, area with higher density of entire home room type (shown in darker purples) are Anson and Geylang. In 2021, areas with higher density of entire home room are Geylang, Chinatown, Whampoa, Anson and Katong. 

###### 6.1.1.3.2.3 Shared Room

The following code chunk is similar to 6.1.1.3.2.1.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")

airbnb0721_sh_map <- tm_shape(kde_airbnb0721SG_sh_bw_raster) + 
                  tm_raster("v", palette = "Purples", alpha = 0.7) +
                  tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")

tmap_arrange(airbnb0619_sh_map, airbnb0721_sh_map)

tmap_mode("plot")
```

Analysis: In 2019, area with higher density of shared room type (shown in darker purples) are Clarke Quay. In 2021, areas with higher density of shared room are Rochor, Jalan Besar and Bencoolen.


###### 6.1.1.3.2.4 Hotel Room

The following code chunk is similar to 6.1.1.3.2.1. The only difference is that this chunk plots only one interactive map since Airbnb0619 do not have Hotel Room as room type.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(kde_airbnb0721SG_ht_bw_raster) + 
    tm_raster("v", palette = "Purples", alpha = 0.7) +
    tm_basemap("OpenStreetMap")

tmap_mode("plot")
```

Analysis: Hotel room is a new room type in 2021. Chinatown is the only area with highest density of Hotel room in 2021.

Overall, we can see that there are changes in each type of rooms, some area became denser and some became less dense from 2019 to 2021. We will focus specifically on Chinatown because the area is the most happening for majority of the room type and the area have the highest density in Hotel room type. Chinatown subzone is under Outram planning area and therefore we will focus on Outram area.

```{r}
summary(airbnb0721_ppp)
```

From the statistic above, we can see that Private room Airbnb in Outram in 2021 made up the highest with 48%, followed by Entire home/apt made up 43%, Hotel and Shared room with about 4% each. The number of Entire home/apt decrease significantly from 4264 in 2019 to 1837 in 2021. The number of Airbnb in Outram generally decreased as a whole, except that there are a new hotel room type.
